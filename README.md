Guess artists of an album by its name
In this game the user has to guess the artist by its album names. In each game there are 5 rounds, each round stands for 1 artist to guess within 3 attempts.

I used AngularJS for front-end, Node.js for backend and iTunes API for music data (<a href="https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/">Read more</a>

Limitations/TBD: 
* Currently supports limitted number of artists
* Need to add visual feedback for the user (on correct/wrong answer) besides the score
